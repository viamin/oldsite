<p>Thanks for booking this room. Please remember that bedding is <i>not</i> furnished with bedding. You will need to bring pillows, a sleeping bag or sheets and blankets. We may have a limited supply of bedding available on a first-come-first-served basis, so contact us if you will not be able to supply your own bedding. </p>
